# My Ruby Koans
This repository tracks my progress to Ruby enlightenment.  It holds my answers to each koan so spoiler alert.  I decided to start this trek toward enlightenment to learn the language my current product team is using to develop, Ruby.  So far it's been great using Test-Driven Development to learn a new language and I am being challenged to learn more about other fundamental programming concepts such as Object Oriented Programming.
